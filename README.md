## Summary
A Junior FullStack Engineering Trainee with 3plus years experience as a data-driven customer centric Business Analyst within an Agile environment. With my previous role exposing me into tech I got really inspired to up-skill and learn to build and maintain software applications. I am looking for a role where I can be hands-on, continue to learn new technologies, develop on my existing knowledge and channel my creativity and problem- solving skills onto creating and maintaining software applications that will solve real life issues and that users will love to use.

## Skills
**Communicator**:

In my previous role, I worked within a cross functional team, which means i had to collaborate, communiciate effectively and act as the liaison among and with different stakeholders of varied business and technical know-how. This involved one-to-one interview sessions, brainstorming workshops that required asking the right questions to stakeholders to understand their current processes and problems and to be able to gather their requirement(both tacit and non-tacit requirements) for any new features.

During my time at Makers I was able to apply this skill during pairing sessions where effective commmunciation was essential for a great outcome of our work together. I further improved my ability to ask the right and open ended questions to maintiam a collaborative environement.


- **Problem Solver**: 

My objective has always being to solve problems, when things do not work the way they should, it gives me an opportunity to analyze their symptoms, identify what's wrong and find solutions. One of the projects I worked on, was Data Hack to improve customer experience and service delivery using data generated from the client's business activities.Teams were required to define problems that can be validated from the data, propose solutions that is backed by the data, thereafter map the process and design a protoype. As the Business Analyst on the team, I elicited requirements and translated them to technical specifications, managed the brainstorming workshop, carried root cuse analysis from the dataset provided, collabroated with the data scientist  on the data and the UI designer with the prototype proposed within a very limited timeframe, I eventually pitched the solution to the stakeholders panel. My team's proposed solution came out second and my work was recognised. 

During Makers this skills has come very handy during pairing and individal task, I remain calm during debugging, I take the time to analyse the stack message and identify where the bug is and recommend probable way to go about solving the bug. During my final project, due to pressure the team had new features breaking other old features on our application, I took the time to actually fix the code base to its normal functioning state.

- **Analytical**:

In my previuos roles, as a Business analyst and also as a research Assistant, I had gained and developed the ability to deconstruct information into smaller categories in order to draw conclusions. These roles required producing reports, interpreting data to provide insights and drawing inferences from data/nformation provided or researched. I resolved requirements conflict within my team by breaking down the requirement into smaller user stories using the SMART and INVEST criteria which improved and increased velocity of the development process for the development team.

In Makers, this skill was very useful during the planning and designing stage, in concluding on the MVP for the application that is being built. Also during debugging, I find being able to break down the problems into smaller bits helps me to solve the problem. Moreso, being analytical has improved my TDD process, by thinking about smaller chunks of the functionality at a time rather than the application as a whole, which makes it easy to identify redundant code, detect and eliminate unnecessary development tasks.

- **Thrive under Pressure**:

Working in an agile environment means working in a pressured environment to deliver, from previous experience I have being in teams where I had to deliver value within a limited timeframe, and being organised and following a plan has always helped me to meet my dealines. 

In Makers, during the final project, my team had two weeks to come up with a working software from ideation to going-live while learning a new tech stack, I remained focused on the goal and also assisted the team members to remain on schedule and still deliver a working software.
