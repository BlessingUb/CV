## Summary
I am a Business Analyst with 3 years plus experience working alongside Product Owners, Product/Project Managers within an Agile environment and recently upskilled by completing the 16 weeks intensive software engineering program with Makers Academy. My previous experience exposed me into tech  however, I was more business oriented. Coming from an engineering academic background and having worked within dev teams I decided to make a switch, trained and self-learnt to become more technical and hands-on! I am looking for Junior Software engineer/developer role where I can continue to learn new technologies, develop on my existing knowledge and channel my creativity and problem solving skills onto creating software apllications that users will love to use.
